Create 3 secrets:\n"," * `NGROK-AUTH-TOKEN` - Your Auth token from the NGrok dashboard\n"," * `NGROK-USERNAME` - The username for the tunnel's HTTP authentication\n"," * `NGROK-PASSWORD` - The username for the tunnel's HTTP authentication\n"," \n"," If not on Kaggle, the code will look for those values in the program's Environment Variables.\n"," \n"," To run the tunnel without a username or password, set the `NGROK-UNSAFE-NO-PASSWORD` secret/env variable.\n","\n","  **-------------------------------**\n","  \n","  **NOTE** running without a username and password is unsafe - NGrok URLs are only obfuscated, mean they can discovered by strangers who can then\n"," connect into your notebook environment and **RUN ARBITRARY CODE** inside it.
